Today I was really tired, but I'm showing up for a Text("Si podemos, Miwel!", style: TextStyle(fontSize: 40, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold, color: Colors.pink))
Still working on the course, frankly I think it is going amazing even though I'm still at half of the second module, I believe if I polish my fundamentals and learn good stuff about flutter I'll be able to build even more stuff that what I'm currently building but on my own this time just using AI tools as reference
